In this folder you can find a collection of free modules previously created for Magento 1.x

These forms are the result of years of web research

All modules belong to their creators. Some can be found on GitHub, others can be downloaded for free from their creators' website, while others were only available via the old Magento store, now closed.

All present modules have been tested and are currently compatible with OpenMage 20.1.1.
