Repository for new Themes by the OpenMage Community

Theme optimized for mobile devices

Changes made:
- modified header.phtml file to be able to insert company logo image and company name, it is sufficient to insert path of the company logo, the company name is an echo of the AltLogo tag
- added promo-label function, it is sufficient to add an attribute with the name "labe" visible in the frontend with options "10%, 20% etc etc" to display a promo label at the top left of the product image. To customize the labels you need to add a customized css file or modify the css classes in the style.css file
